			        <p>Client-side tool that uses third-party analytics to provide a snapshot of generated lead data.  This single load application application was built using jQuery, Javascript, Google Charts and Highcharts.  I also built the backend which pulls in the data from an FTP file upload, converts it and then stores it in the database.  The data is then pulled in using JSON, placed in charts and displayed to the user.</p>
